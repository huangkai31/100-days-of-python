# 100 Days Of Python - Log

### Day 1: 20190315

**Today's Progress**: 3 exercises from practicepython.org

**Thoughts:** I like coding, alough I did several python projects since 2010, I still find something to learn everyday. So I found the idea of 100 days of code and I think : Hey , I can use this method to refresh my python knowledge and learn/relearn something every day.
